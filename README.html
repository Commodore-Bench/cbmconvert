<H2>1 Introduction</H2>

<P>There are many archiving programs for the Commodore 64, all of
which are incompatible with archiving programs on other systems.  This
<CODE>cbmconvert</CODE> utility tries to address this problem.  It
extracts files from most known file formats and writes them to several
different formats, including some formats used by some Commodore 64
emulators.</P>

<P>This release of <CODE>cbmconvert</CODE> does not contain LHARC
support any more, since 1541 disk images (either plain or ZipCoded)
and Lynx archives are much easier to handle.  If you need LHARC
support, get the older release, cbmconvert 1.1.</P>

<P>All code has been cleaned up.  The file type management in
<CODE>cbmconvert 2.0.5</CODE> is very flexible, and it is very easy to
add file types later.  Currently cbmconvert reads the following file
types: Arkive, Lynx, ARC64/128, PC64, disk images (1541, 1571, 1581,
both native and C128 CP/M format), and raw files.  Conversions between
1541 disk images and ZipCoded files can be made with the two supplied
utilities <CODE>disk2zip</CODE> and <CODE>zip2disk</CODE>.

<H2>2 Getting Started</H2>

<H3>2.1 UNIX</H3>

<P>Compile <CODE>cbmconvert</CODE> by entering <KBD>make unix</KBD>.
If you do not have GNU C compiler (<KBD>gcc</KBD>) installed on your
system, you will need to edit the <CODE>Makefile</CODE>.</P>

<P>The compilation should leave you with three executables:
<CODE>cbmconvert</CODE>, <CODE>zip2disk</CODE> and
<CODE>disk2zip</CODE>.  Install these to your binaries directory, and
you are ready to go.  Ask your system administrator and/or a local
guru if you do not know where to install the binaries.  Or just use
them from the current directory.</P>

<H3>2.2 AmigaDOS</H3>

<P>There is a make file for AmigaDOS in <KBD>smakefile</KBD> (written
by <A HREF="mailto:albert@cs.tut.fi">Pasi Ojala</A>), but it is not up
to date, and I don't remember for which compiler it is.  You could use
GNU C as well.</P>

<H3>2.3 MS-DOS</H3>

<P>You can compile <KBD>cbmconvert</KBD> for MS-DOS with DJGPP by
using the supplied <KBD>Makefile</KBD>.  The required patches were
friendly supplied by <A HREF="mailto:womo@mindless.com">Wolfgang
Moser</A>.</P>

<P>16-bit compilers will probably have trouble with cbmconvert.  For
instance, the standard file I/O library in Borland C uses signed
16-bit integers for <CODE>size_t</CODE>, which is not enough.</P>

<H2>3 Using <CODE>cbmconvert</CODE></H2>

<P>Starting with version 2.0.0, <CODE>cbmconvert</CODE> consists of
three programs:</P>

<DL>
 <DT><KBD>cbmconvert</KBD></DT>
 <DD>The main program that makes most conversions.</DD>
 <DT><KBD>disk2zip</KBD></DT>
 <DD>ZipCode creator.  Encodes a 35-track 1541 disk image
 to four ZipCode files (1!filename..4!filename).</DD>
 <DT><KBD>zip2disk</KBD></DT>
 <DD>ZipCode dissolver.  Decodes a 35-track 1541 disk image
 from four ZipCode files.</DD>
</DL>

<H3>3.1 <KBD>cbmconvert</KBD></H3>

<P>Since version 2.0, <KBD>cbmconvert</KBD> has independent file
reader and writer modules that are controlled through a main program.
There is only a command-line interface, but adding an interactive user
interface should be easy (any volunteers?).</P>

<P><KBD>cbmconvert</KBD> reads all files in all input files you
specify on the command line and writes them in the format you specify.
If you want to copy only some files from a set of archive files to an
archive file or disk image, you will have to extract all the files to
a single-file format such as the PC64 format, and to copy the wanted
individual files to the output archive with another invocation of
<KBD>cbmconvert</KBD>.</P>

<P>You can get a list of <KBD>cbmconvert</KBD> options by invoking
the program without any arguments.  <KBD>cbmconvert</KBD> supports
following file formats:</P>

<DL>
 <DT>Raw files</DT>
 <DD>Files with just the raw data.  Written with the <KBD>-I</KBD> and
 <KBD>-N</KBD> options, read with the <KBD>-n</KBD> option.</DD>
 <DT>PC64 files</DT>
 <DD>Also known as "P00" files.  Written with the <KBD>-P</KBD> option,
 read with the <KBD>-p</KBD> option.</DD>
 <DT>Lynx archives</DT>
 <DD>Written with <KBD>-L</KBD>, read with <KBD>-l</KBD>.</DD>
 <DT>C128 CP/M disk images</DT>
 <DD>Written with <KBD>-C[478]</KBD>, read with <KBD>-c</KBD>.</DD>
 <DT>CBM DOS disk images</DT>
 <DD>Written with <KBD>-D[478]</KBD>, read with <KBD>-d</KBD>.
 1571 and 1581 support have not been tested properly, and not
 all 1581 features are implemented.</DD>
 <DT>ARC/SDA</DT>
 <DD>Read with <KBD>-a</KBD>.  No write support.</DD>
 <DT>Arkive</DT>
 <DD>Read with <KBD>-k</KBD>.  No write support.</DD>
 <DT>T64</DT>
 <DD>Read with <KBD>-t</KBD>.  No write support.</DD>
</DL>

<H4>3.1.1 CP/M disk images</H4>

<P>Since cbmconvert has been written exclusively with Commodore file
names in mind, the support for CP/M disk images is a bit clumsy.  You
may want to rename the files after extracting them from the disks.
For instance, if you have downloaded the CP/M disk images from
http://www.funet.fi/pub/cbm/demodisks/c128/, you can use the following
commands in <CODE>bash</CODE> to extract the files from the disk
images:</P>

<PRE>
gunzip *.d64.gz

for i in *.d64; do mkdir ${i%.d64}; cd ${i%.d64}; cbmconvert -c ../$i; cd ..; done

for i in */*.prg; do mv $i "`echo ${i%.prg}|tr A-Z a-z`"; done
</PRE>

<P>CP/M does not store the exact length of the files anywhere.  That
is why many CP/M programs create files whose length is a multiple of
128 bytes.  Text files in CP/M commonly use ^Z as an end-of-file
delimiter, and many programs fill the extra bytes in the last 128-byte
block of the file with this character.  The CP/M routines in
cbmconvert does so as well, and it removes the  padding when reading
the files.  So, you could use cbmconvert to remove the padding.  But
you may prefer the following <CODE>bash</CODE> command (requires Perl
5):</P>

<PRE>
for i in *; do perl -i -e 'undef $/; $_=&lt;&gt;; while(/\032$/){chop} print' "$i"; done
</PRE>

<H4>3.1.2 GEOS disk images</H4>

<P>GEOS files on disk images will be handled transparently by
converting them to and from the Convert format on the fly.  All unused
areas in the Convert file will be zeroed out, and all possible
integrity checks will be made in both conversions.  If the file is
interpreted to be in GEOS or Convert format, and it fails in any
integrity check, it will be treated as a native Commodore file.</P>

<P>You should note that Convert does not provide much safety for the
file.  For sequential files, the original file length is not stored
anywhere.  For VLIR files, it is, but even then there are no
checksums.</P>

<P>As a speciality, all GEOS files have a file information block.  The
contents of this block can be viewed with the simple Perl script
<KBD>cvtinfo.pl</KBD> that reads files in Convert format.  It was just
a quick hack; feel free to make it more robust.</P>

<P>The GEOS routines have been tested with twelve 1541 disk images and
with several megabytes of <KBD>*.cvt</KBD> files, and they are
believed to be error free now.  There were problems with the VLIR
sector format; Mr. Boyce's reverse engineered information about it was
incorrect, or at least inadequate.</P>

<H4>3.1.3 Flaws of <KBD>cbmconvert</KBD></H4>

<P>The conversion may lose some file name or attribute information.
In some cases, the filenames will be converted from PETSCII to ASCII
or vice versa, and some PETSCII or ASCII specific characters will be
lost in the conversions.  Non-standard directory information available
in some formats will be lost as well.</P>

<P>Lynx, Arkive and ARC allow duplicate filenames.  But
<CODE>cbmconvert</CODE> detects them and refuses to write multiple
files with identical names to archives or to disk images.  These
duplicates are often used as directory separators, to separate groups
of filenames. If you really need such separators, use 1-block-long PRG
or SEQ files with different names.  For example, the first separator
can be a string of 16 dashes, the second one can be 15 dashes, and so
on.</P>

<P>Arkive also works on illegal file types that cannot be created
without directly modifying the directory blocks.  Such files will be
converted to a supported file type.  Files with unknown types on disk
images will be skipped.</P>

<P>Handling the errors on disk images could be more robust.  Not all
(typically BAM-related) errors on CBM DOS disk images are detected.
For erroneous 1541 disk images that do not work with the new
<KBD>cbmconvert</KBD>, you may want to try the <KBD>disk2files</KBD>
program of the previous release.</P>

<H3>3.2 <KBD>disk2zip</KBD></H3>

<P>This program converts a standard 35-track, 683-block 1541 disk
image to ZipCode format.  Because the ZipCode format stores the disk
identifier, this conversion adds information.  You can use the
<KBD>-i</KBD> option to specify the disk identifier.</P>

<H3>3.3 <KBD>zip2disk</KBD></H3>

<P>ZipCoded archives consist of four files prefixed with a number from
1 to 4, and a exclamation point. To extract an archive having the
files "1!disk", "2!disk", "3!disk" and "4!disk", command "zip2disk
disk".  You may then delete the original files with "rm [1-4]\!disk"
or similar.  But note that some software (demos and copy-protected
software) may rely on the disk identifier, which will not be stored in
the 1541 disk image file.</P>

<P>Support for ZipCode SixPacks ("1!!disk", "2!!disk", ..., "6!!disk")
could be added easily, but this format is used mainly for really
custom 1541 disks with abnormal low-level format, for which there
doesn't exist any commonly agreed representation format.</P>

<H2>4 Credits</H2>

<P>Most of the cbmconvert package was written by Marko Mäkelä.  The
original version appeared in 1993, and a complete rewrite was started
in 1997 and finished in 1998.</P>

<P>The zip2disk module was originally programmed by <A
HREF="mailto:h0142kdd@rz.hu-berlin.de">Paul David Doherty</A>.  The
ISO 9660 compliant filename truncation algorithm was taken from the
T64TOP00 utility created by Wolfgang Lorenz as a part of his now
discontinued PC64 emulator.</P>

<P>Support for 1581 CBM DOS disk images was programmed by <A
HREF="mailto:albert@cs.tut.fi">Pasi Ojala</A>.</P>

<P>The ARC/SDA dissolving code was originally written by Chris
Smeets.</P>

<P>The necessary information for supporting GEOS was provided by <A
HREF="mailto:sta@ludens.elte.hu">Joe Forster/STA</A>, <A
HREF="mailto:doug.cotton@cmdweb.com">Doug Cotton</A>, Alexander Boyce
(author of the unofficial GEOS Programmer's Reference Guide) and by
the anonymous author of the file "convertfrmt.txt".</P>

<H3>4.1 Patches</H3>

<DL>
 <DT>Version 2.0.5: </DT>
 <DD><A HREF="mailto:Mikko.Suonio@iki.fi">Mikko Suonio</A> provided
 patches for tolerating truncated T64 and Lynx archives.  His patches
 also handle single-file T64 archives that have number of entries set
 to zero, and Lynx archives that have file names starting with a space.</DD>
 <DT>Version 2.0.5.1: </DT>
 <DD>It was brought to my attention that Lynx 17 on the Commodore 64 and
 some other utilities do not recognize the Lynx archives created by
 cbmconvert.  I slightly modified the magic cookie to fix the problem.
